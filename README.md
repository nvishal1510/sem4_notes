# Sem 4 Notes 

<!-- Update: MA 214 is up to date (22-02-2021).  -->

This repo consists of notes for the courses that I am taking as Mech sophomore at IIT Bombay. Part of it is running notes during the classes. Other part is the gist that I understand when I read the topic.
Feel free to use them to your liking. Also I suggest you to check the sections of the courses to avoid any confusion.

| Course | Section | Comment |
|--------|---------|----------
|MA 214  | S2      | This is the most organised and well written of all.|
|ME 202  | S1      | This mostly contains derivations and formulas. |
|ME 206  | S1      | I had not written notes for some part (quite a lot, actually!) of syllabus before midsem.|
|ME 226  | S2      | The course content (that is being taught) to me is mostly philosophical,</br>so it mostly contains definitions and some philosophy. |
|ME 213L | S1      | Not much to write here. You can find the table of machine codes.|
|ME 766  | -       | 			|
|CS 213  | -       | The notes only contain pointers, actual learning is by practise.|



These notes have not been thoroughly proofread (may do it during exams), so you can expect some typos and grammar mistakes. 
There also might be some errors in the theory. I would highly appreciate it, if you could point them out to me. 

You can contact me at nvishal1510@gmail.com or ~~whatsapp~~ signal me. 

A request to the reader - If you see any notes lagging too far behind the course content, hit me with a firm message to study (please be gentle :sweat_smile:).

Writing notes in LaTex has been inspired from [@aryamanmaithani](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani) whose [MA 105](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-105-tut) and [MA 106](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-106-tut) tuts which have been very helpful during my freshie year.
